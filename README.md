# learning-haskell

This repository contains projects which I've created to delve into world of functional programming using Haskell. The first - and only so far - is an implementation of Noughts & Crosses or Tic Tac Toe written in Haskell. It doubtless terrible Haskell code - especially relating to the implementation of the minimax function which is ghastly and slow - but, I'm confident I will refactor it in future.
